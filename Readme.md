# AutoForge Motors: Database Analysis & Insights

## Overview
This project offers an in depth review of car sales data in Rwanda for AutoForge Motors. By leveraging advanced SQL window functions, the goal is to analyze regional sales performance, discern customer behavior trends, and derive strategic recommendations.

## Database Overview
### Schema
The database consists of three central tables:
- **Customers**: Stores customer identity data including name, region, and registration date.
- **Cars**: Contains car model details such as model name, category, and base price.
- **Sales**: Records each transaction linking customers and car models along with sale date, quantity, and total sale amount.

For a visual representation of the schema, see the diagram below:

## Queries and Functional Analysis

The analysis employs four types of SQL window function queries:

1. **Ranking Functions**
   - Determines the top five car models per district per quarter.
   - Uses dense ranking to analyze Q2 sales in the Huye district.

2. **Aggregate Functions**
   - Computes the cumulative monthly revenue by district.
   - Calculates a three-month moving average for the "SUV Terra" model.

3. **Navigation Functions**
   - Analyzes month-over-month revenue growth using the LAG function.
   - Forecasts subsequent month's revenue with the LEAD function.

4. **Distribution Functions**
   - Segments customers into spending quartiles based on purchase data.
   - Computes the cumulative distribution of customer spending.

## Insights & Analysis

### 1. Descriptive Analysis
- **Patterns**: Consistent performance by the SUV Terra model and periodic sales surges, especially in urban areas.
- **Trends**: Noticeable seasonal peaks in Q2 and Q4, along with cumulative growth over time.
- **Outliers**: Remarkable spikes in the luxury segment sales (see Rubavu Monthly Growth below).

### 2. Diagnostic Analysis
- **Underlying Causes**: Elevated transaction values in urban centers due to higher disposable incomes; seasonal peaks align with local economic activity cycles.
- **Comparisons**: Kigali regions show up to 40% higher average sales compared to rural areas, corroborated by data in sales reports.
- **Influencing Factors**: Government initiatives and infrastructure improvements notably impact vehicle choice and sales volumes.

### 3. Prescriptive Analysis
- **Recommendations**:
  - **Inventory Optimization**: Adjust stock according to regional demand; increase EV availability in areas with rising adoption.
  - **Targeted Marketing**: Develop promotional strategies for high-demand models and segment-specific campaigns.
  - **Business Development**: Expand charging infrastructure and enhance service centers, particularly in emerging markets.
